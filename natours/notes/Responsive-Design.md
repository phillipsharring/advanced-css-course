# Responsive Design

## Basic Responsive Design Principles

### 1. Fluid Grids and Layouts

To allow content to easily adapt to the current viewport width used to browse the website. Uses %rather than px for all layout-related lengths.

### 2. Flxible/Responsive Images

Images behave differently than text content, and so we need to ensure that they also adapt nicely to the current viewport.

### 3. Media Queries

To change styles on certain viewport widths (breakpoints), allowing us to create a different version of our website for different widths

## Layout Types

1. Float Layouts <--- still used everywhere, 1st project
1. Flexbox <-- 2nd project
1. CSS Grid <-- 3rd project
