# SASS

Variables: for reusable values such as colors, font-sizes, spacing, etc.

Nesting: to nest selectors inside of one another, allowing us to write less code

Operators: for mathematical operations right inside of CSS

Partials and imports: to write css in different files and import them all into one single file

Mixins: to write reusable pieces of CSS code

Functions: similar to mixins, with the difference that they produce a value that can be used

Extends: to make different selectors inherit declarations that are common to all of them

Control directives: for writing complex code using conditionals and loops (not covered in this course)

Syntax

& = "path up to this point"

mixin styles rules are inserted into a selector

extends a selector is slapped onto a bunch of rules
